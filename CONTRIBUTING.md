## Translations

If you would like to help with translations, please sign up for Crowdin and join our [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/linearmouse) to translate LinearMouse into supported languages.

If you want to add a new language, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/linearmouse/linearmouse/issues/new) and I will be happy to enable that language for you to translate.

##### Step 1. Select the language you want to contribute to:

It is recommended to sign in Crowdin with GitHub, so that I can add you as a co-author when I merge the pull request.

##### Step 3. Translate and save strings.

New translations will be synced in one hour.
