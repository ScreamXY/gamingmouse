# Accessibility permission

LinearMouse requires accessibility features to work properly.
You need to grant Accessibility permission at first launch.

## Upgrade from v0.6.1 or earlier

**Code signing certificate has been updated after v0.6.1. If you upgrade LinearMouse from v0.6.1
or earlier to a newer version, you will also need to re-grant the permission.**

Please remove LinearMouse from Accessibility permissions and
re-add it.

## Reset Accessibility permissions

If there is something wrong with permissions, you may also reset all the Accessibility permissions.
This will remove all the granted permissions and after that you can re-grant Accessibility permission for LinearMouse.
